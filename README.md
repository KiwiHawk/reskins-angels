**A work-in-progress complete visual overhaul of Arch666Angel's suite of mods**  
This mod reskins the items, structures, equipment, and technologies added to Factorio by Angel's Mods, adding tier coloring and labels. As part of this, structures have been re-rendered in high resolution with Angel's permission (which will eventually be ported into the base Angel's mods). 

As re-rendering efforts are time consuming, and on-going, coloring has been prepared for every relevant structure in Angel's suite, and as models are re-rendered, sprites will be replaced with the new version.

**Update Schedule**  
Regular content and low-impact bugs will be released monthly.  
Critical bug fixes will be deployed on an as-needed basis.  
Locale updates will be released on the weekend of the week in which they are received from Crowdin.
